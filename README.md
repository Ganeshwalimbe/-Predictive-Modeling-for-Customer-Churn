# Predictive-Modeling-for-Customer-Churn

## Objective :
The objective of this assignment is to build a predictive model that can predict customer churn for a given company. The intern will use machine learning techniques to build the model and document the process, including feature selection, model evaluation, and performance metrics.

## Steps involved

Data preprocessing :

1.Data cleaning

2.Encoding of data 

3.Handling imbalanced data

4.Standardization of data

## Summary:
Prediction models observations

Among all the prediction models Random forest model has given highest accuracy of 98 % to predict customer churn. therefore we can use random forest model for the prediction of customer churn.
The top 5 important features to predict the customer churn according to random forest model are balance,age,day,campaign and pdays.
The limitations of using a Random Forest model to predict customer churn are:

Random Forest models are prone to overfitting, which can lead to inaccurate predictions.
Random Forest models are computationally expensive and require a lot of time to train and test.
Random Forest models are difficult to interpret, as the resulting decision trees are often very complex and hard to understand.
To overcome these limitations, future work could include:

Exploring alternative models such as Support Vector Machines, Neural Networks, and Ensemble models. Additionally, feature selection and regularization techniques could be used to reduce overfitting and improve accuracy. Finally, data visualization techniques could be used to gain a better understanding of the data and the resulting decision trees.
